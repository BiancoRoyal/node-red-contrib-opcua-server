# node-red-contrib-opcua-server
A programmable OPC UA server for Node-RED based on node-opcua next generation version with less dependencies.

Core
-------

using next generation node-opcua version from [Etienne Rossignon](https://github.com/erossignon/)

Install
-------

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

        npm install node-red-contrib-opcua-server

try these options on npm install to build from source if you have problems to install

        --unsafe-perm --build-from-source

Debug
--------

Debugging on remote devices is important to help users. The verbose logging
provides interesting points in different abstractions if IDE or console debugging is not possible.

Start debug with Node-RED in verbose (-v) mode to get a verbose logging:

    DEBUG=opcuaCompact* node-red -v 1>Node-RED-OPC-UA-Server.log 2>&1

or on local Node-RED

    DEBUG=opcuaCompact* node red.js -v 1>Node-RED-OPC-UA-Server.log 2>&1
